## 💼 Summary

An inquisitive mind is not something to be left alone.

I thrive on solving problems and puzzles for the advancement of humanity.

I'm a pragmatic software developer with 15+ years of experience at Teledyne IIS, focusing on real-time camera systems, stereo vision pipelines, and high-performance computing. With a strong foundation in **Computational Mathematics** from RMIT University, I specialize in C++, CUDA, and embedded systems—building low-level solutions that integrate tightly with hardware.

I enjoy exploring the intersection of engineering, optics, and code—especially in stereo imaging, image processing pipelines, and system-level integration. Always hands-on, I value clarity, correctness, and control over the tech I build.

## 🛠️ Projects

- **CUDA Demosaicing Pipeline** – Fast CUDA port of the Menon 2007 DFPD algorithm using Eigen matrices and asynchronous memory handling.  
- **Point Cloud Viewer** – Qt-based OpenGL viewer with full camera control (pitch, yaw, roll, zoom, pan) and binary/text PLY support.  
- **Stereo Depth System** – Host-side calibration generates lookup tables used for image rectification; disparity calculated using SGBM with 1/64th subpixel precision.  
- **Ladybug CMake Refactor** – Modularized and integrated legacy Makefile project into a clean, modern CMake structure.

## 🧪 Technical Interests

- Image signal pipelines (demosaic, focus scoring, disparity)  
- Embedded vision systems and camera software stacks  
- Workflow automation and zero-boilerplate design  
- Performance debugging (Nsight, memcheck, async profiling)  
- Reverse engineering devices and legacy systems  
- Playing with Neovim because sometimes IDEs are too much

## 🧍 About Me

- I code like I mean it—and I usually do.  
- “Lazy” means solving a problem once so I never have to again.  
- I’d rather wrap a C++ function than argue about the `const` keyword.  
- Probably debugging a race condition at 3am or hacking on Gentoo.  
- Enjoys sci-fi, space sims, Star Citizen, Factorio, and meaningful work.

## 👨‍👩‍👦 Personal

- A husband and father
- Enjoy building intuitive tech for non-tech users (even in-laws)  
- Designed systems for operator comfort (e.g. paisley focus targets)  
- A lifelong learner with a purpose: build things that matter
